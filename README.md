A Hangman Game created using HTML, CSS and PHP. The signup page is the starting point Create a username and password and then it redirects you to the login page If using wrong password then you will get an error message after logging in is complete you can then go to the index page to choose your level The higher the level the longer the words and less detailed clues For each level you choose a letter to guess the word correct letters give you no change but an update in the word display will happen incorrect letter guesses will update the hangman image and display a body part if you are stuck on the word you can click clue and a clue will appear at the top for the corresponding word If you guess the right word than you will be congratulated and then can proceed to the next level if you get the word wrong then you can restart the level by clicking the restart buttong for new word Please attempt to go through all the levels and words(there are five words per a level)

The game itself will be playable but we had technical difficulties getting the signup,loginpage mysql parts to work with the codd server. However we did show thhat the login page, signup page, and mysql all worked on local.
